# Hack for Change: Workplace Inclusion Using AI

## Introduction
Welcome! As you'll have seen from the brief you received, the mission of this hackathon is to leverage artificial intelligence to create practical solutions that promote positive change in the workplace. You have the freedom to think big and innovate, but practicality suggests using existing APIs like OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 for a quicker and more feasible development cycle.

## Scope
The aperture for this challenge is left deliberately wide, allowing you to develop anything from chatbots that facilitate communication among diverse groups to AI-driven HR solutions that help identify and eliminate biases in the hiring process, or whatever else you can imagine that fits the given theme of AI for positive change in the workplace.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Basic programming knowledge in Java, Node.js, Python, or any other programming language you're comfortable with.
2. Access to OpenAI API (GPT-3 or GPT-4)

### Examples
A Java example showcasing how to use the OpenAI API is included in this repository. If you prefer other programming languages like Node.js or Python, plenty of examples are readily available online.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Practicality and ease of implementation
- Innovativeness and originality
- Effectiveness in promoting workplace inclusion
