# Hack for Change: Technical Guide

## Introduction

Welcome! As you'll have seen from the brief you received, the mission of this hackathon is to leverage artificial intelligence to create practical solutions that promote positive change in the workplace. You have the freedom to think big and innovate, but practicality suggests using existing APIs like OpenAI's GPT-3 or GPT-4 for a quicker and more feasible development cycle.

## Scope

The aperture for this challenge is left deliberately wide, allowing you to develop anything from chatbots that facilitate communication among diverse groups to AI-driven HR solutions that help identify and eliminate biases in the hiring process, or whatever else you can imagine that fits the given theme of AI for positive change in the workplace.

## Mentorship

You will have been assigned a technical mentor to give you guidance when required. Please check in with them periodically, particularly early on, to 'sanity check' your concept before completing any significant amount of feature development.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
1. Basic programming knowledge in Java, Node.js, Python, or any other programming language you're comfortable with.
2. Access to OpenAI API (GPT-3 or GPT-4)

### Examples
A Java example showcasing how to use the OpenAI API is included in this repository. If you prefer other programming languages like Node.js or Python, plenty of examples are readily available online.
